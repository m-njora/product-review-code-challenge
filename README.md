Product Review

# Project Description
For this assignment, we'll be working with an e-commerce domain. We'll be focusing on the product reviews.

We have three models: User, Review, and Product.

For our purposes, a Product has many Users, a User has many Productsâ€™ s, and a Review belongs to a User and to a Product.
